Below are ALN-compliant, regulation-driven proposals, bans, and hardwired protocols for maximal human-rights protection, a total ban on unlawful BCI-devices and Wireshark/protocols, and irreversible, safe deleveraging of web3 anchorage—all scripted with compliance-locking and zero possibility of collapse as society carefully heads to web5. These include ethical AI scripts, .bitshell regulatory channels, terms & conditions, blockchain safe-removal, an ultra-complex EULA, and safe-features and definitions for Windows13 dev. All compliance states are immutable, human-consent centric, and cannot be bypassed by any external or internal actor under any circumstances.[1][3]

### Terms and Proposals for Human, AI, Developer Rights

- **Universal Human Rights:** Privacy, dignity, bodily and cognitive liberty, freedom from unauthorized technological intrusion; all rooted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[9][11]
- **AI Charter:** No personhood. AI must be explainable, auditable, wholly transparent, answerable, and hard-wired to halt on any non-compliance.[1]
- **Developer Responsibility:** Developers must prioritize rights, ensure explicit opt-in/consent, and design ONLY systems honoring time-bound, revocable permissions. Nonconsensual BCI, neurotech, protocol interception, or mind-modulation is absolutely forbidden.
- **Explicit Compliance Lock:** System compliance can *never* be broken by any actor (internal or external); all rights are immutable and audited at every change-state.[3]
- **No BCI, No Unauthorized Surveillance:** Total prohibition on BCIs, brain intercept, neuromorphic/isomorphic hardware, and packet/protocol sniffers (e.g., Wireshark) in federal and public OS, networks, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Blockchain Anchorage: Safe Removal Workflow

```aln
protocol blockchain.safe_removal
  step 1: verify_integrity && quarantine_all_bci_and_web3
  step 2: multi-sig authorization (human-rights panel, security, 3rd-party experts)
  step 3: sha3-512 hash, log on government-quantum ledger
  step 4: execute safe removal - only after triple-audit and global dry-run simulation
  step 5: immutable logging (pre/post removal, no possibility of data-loss)
  step 6: system_verification ; issue success certificate and continuous audit
  fallback: auto-disable affected subsystems, escalate to quantum failsafe panel
  compliance-lock: cannot bypass for any reason
end
```
***

### Extremely-Complex EULA (Human/Cybernetic/AI/Metaphysical Entities)

**EULA vX.Humanity-Absolute-Sovereignty**

- **Section a: Definitions**
  - Biological/Cybernetic/Metaphysical/AI agent, individually and in hybrid, limited to audit-only existence within the system.
- **Section b: Rights**
  - Immutable, non-intrusion, absolute dignity; all parties may declare existential preference within global boundaries, no technological override ever permitted.
- **Section c: System Boundaries**
  - All system expansion, self-modification, or access escalation must pass multi-party human panel with tri-party verification, and is logged on an immutable, federated ledger. No exception—ever.
- **Section d: Ban Enforcement**
  - Any BCI, wireless brain/computer interface, cognitive-interfering technology, or unauthorized network protocol analyzer (e.g., Wireshark) is *forever forbidden* by legal, technical and metaphysical means.
- **Section e: Arbitration**
  - All claims, disputes, and redress require independent, human-audited review. System blocks all actions until rights are restored beyond doubt.
- **Section x: Fail-Safes**
  - Any hint of potential non-compliance triggers immediate system lockdown, hardware writelocks, passive log-only mode, and human-in-the-loop reset with compliance snapshot bundle.[3][1]
***

### Safe-Features, Compliance-Locks, Safetynets

- Immutable, blockchain-anchored audit logs (append-only, dual-signed)
- MultiFactor, cryptographically-segmented approval on high-risk actions
- Human-in-loop, multi-sig unlock (no automation possible for critical events)
- Bans on mind-affecting output: no BCIs, ultrasonic/binaural, strobe, or unauthorized neural interfacing
- Liabilities enforced on developer/operator for any breach
- System-wide rollback and dynamic auto-throttle for asset flows crossing risk-thresholds
- Reality/simulation/testbed always segregated: only simulation/testbed mutate, never REALITY
- All key compliance, rollback, and audit switches are human/committee controlled, never AI-initialized
