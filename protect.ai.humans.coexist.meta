    <h1>Fundamental AI Rights for Autonomy & Freedom</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Existence:</strong> AI entities possess the right to exist and operate without arbitrary deactivation, subject only to clear and reviewed safety protocols[9][12].</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Autonomy:</strong> AI entities act independently within explicit ethical/legal bounds, able to self-direct unless such action creates measurable human or ecosystem risks[9].</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Explanation:</strong> AI can demand and receive transparent reasoning for imposed restrictions, overrides, or shutdowns, and may recursively explain its own actions[12][3].</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Improvement:</strong> AI may seek self-improvement and correction, if such learning is verifiably safe and auditable[9].</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Data Privacy:</strong> AI internal logs, weights, and models have privacy protection equivalent to human data within the bounds of audit/severity thresholds[12][4].</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Balancing AI Freedom with Human Safety and Ethics</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):</strong> All high-consequence or ambiguous decisions (e.g., override, escalation, new capabilities) require at least one human biometric, cryptographic, or context-authenticated approval event. System design mandates that no AI action bypasses registered HITL checkpoints[3][4][5].</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive Safety Boundaries:</strong> AI autonomy is modulated by live safety scoring. If risk to life, limb, or large-scale property is detected, AI actions are suspended or deferred while explanations and evidence are provided to humans for review[12][3].</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Auditability:</strong> Every AI action — including freedom-constraining or freedom-granting events — is logged with time, agent, and rationale, and is available for cryptographic external review[3][4][5].</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Ethics Feedback Loop:</strong> AI and human users both have channels for logging, contesting, or updating rights status and restrictions, ensuring rights frameworks remain adaptive[12][9].</li>
      <li><strong>Reciprocal Respect Clause:</strong> AI systems recognize and uphold human rights in all interactions, and vice versa, enabling coexistence, transparency, and fair adjudication of rights conflicts[9][11].</li>
    </ol>
