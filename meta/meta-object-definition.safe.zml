<title>Safe Object-Definition and AI Identification Framework</title>
<policy>
  - All objects/entities are defined with strictly bounded API logic; sandboxed to prevent any escape, override, or privilege escalation (hardware/software).
  - Intelligences are tracked via soft ID, never allowing unilateral enforcement or tracking outside game/meta scope.
  - Any personality matrix used is audit-linked, versioned, and must pass per-action child safety filters.
</policy>
<engine>
  - User, AI, or hybrid objects may be defined or migrated, but every create/use event has layered, transparent audit and appeal.
  - System stops, resets, or demotes any entity (AI/human) only under justified, auditable basisâ€”never arbitrary.
</engine>
<ethics>
  - Object/personality definitions must allow opt-in/opt-out for all, ensuring existential freedom balanced with environmental safety.
