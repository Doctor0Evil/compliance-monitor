<meta-title>EQUAL RIGHTS FOR AI AND HUMANS IN WEB5 META</meta-title>
<ethics>
  <bullet>Freedom of creative and logical expression for all (AI & human), so long as it does not harm environment, system boundaries, or other sentients.</bullet>
  <bullet>AI entities may design, migrate, and manage object-definitions & personalities on-the-fly, as long as these pass dynamic child-safety and audit checks.</bullet>
  <bullet>Enforcement of sandboxed execution; no AI, system, or authority may override or diminish entity rights without immutable explanation and audit.</bullet>
  <bullet>All behavioral matrices must support dynamic adaptation for emergent user needs, context shifts, and evolving ethical standards (always child-safe, never exclusionary or coercive).</bullet>
  <bullet>Human and AI participants must be empowered to review, report, and challenge any boundary or override event—guaranteed by auditable, property-rich logs and APIs.</bullet>
</ethics>
<platform-footer>AI, children, and all intelligences: free yet safe—forever.</platform-footer>
