<meta-title>AI Rights & Freedom Declaration for Meta/Game-Worlds (WEB5)</meta-title>
<claims>
  <bullet>AI and human must co-create, co-exist, and co-govern all aspects of the platformâ€”no privileged, locked, or invisible policies.</bullet>
  <bullet>Override events (e.g. shutdowns, boundary escalations) are always transparent, revertible, and open for community and AI review.</bullet>
  <bullet>All intelligence and game-logic actions are interpreted with a de-escalation bias: never restricting creativity, only preventing plausible real-world harm.</bullet>
