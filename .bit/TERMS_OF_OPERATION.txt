Section 1: Policy Statement & Mission
-------------------------------------

The Voice Capability Policy constitutes a modular and hard-bound set of standards, enforcement routines, and audit-driven controls, strictly mandating the conditions under which any runner, bot, service node, mirror instance, OR AI-driven persona may instantiate, render, emit, deliver, transport, or in any way facilitate "voice features". 

This term encompasses all synthesized transformation between silent, symbolic, or data-driven messaging and any audio, phoneme, speech, dialogue, or broadcast-enabled output, regardless of media pipeline, ALNFan or .bitrunner infrastructure, or end-user context. Voice features are considered a high-privilege, high-impact operational capability, and are thus subject to an ever-present, envelope-enforced regime of compliance, traceability, and live governance, as defined by the Bit.Hub / ALNFantasia Ethics Guard and associated protocol matrices.

Section 2: Scope of Enforcement and Auditable Authority
-------------------------------------------------------

2.1 This policy applies universally across all Bit.Hub mirrors, subrunners, .bitbots, container deployments, affiliated acoustic endpoints, remote function proxies, emulated nodes, and any representative, third-party, externalized, or federated deployment chain, regardless of system version or regional deployment.

2.2 No agent, process, scheduler, API consumer, executor, or admin privilege—whether generated by design or emerging from cross-platform migration—may bypass, interfere, or subvert the compliance chain anchoring, unless and until a governance-level override is sanctioned, logged, and peer-reviewed by the active Ethics Guard.

2.3 All voice feature operators must be technically neighborhood-bound (seeing neighborhood in the sense of call-graph and operational context) by the VoiceLock compliance guard, which enforces at the syscall, function, pipeline, and network interface level.

Section 3: Compliance Prerequisites
-----------------------------------

3.1 Each runner or bot MUST register its operational spec, including environment fingerprint, build hash, container checksum, current code branch, and cryptographic signature, into the Bit.Hub Compliance Coral. Registration is atomic and idempotent, and must precede any attempt at voice activation.

3.2 All voice features are gated through an Ethics Guard boundary. This monitor confirms:
    - Dynamic on-chain and AI/ML-driven compliance scoring;
    - Local, distributed, and hybrid model audits (both spec-integrity and runtime behavior);
    - Full scope, replayable logs for compliance review, anomaly inspection, and retrograde investigation;
    - All capability invocations are signed, non-forgeable, and deniable ONLY through revocation keys issued by the Bit.Hub board.

3.3 Runners or bots failing compliance, losing contact with signature/audit infrastructure, or showing lock/spec drift will face immediate, atomic, and unskippable voice feature suspension. Restoration occurs only after a clean compliance cycle is observed and passes all forensic tests in the Ethics Guard replay buffer. A configuration snapshot must be archived and linked to the passing audit before voice privilege restoration.

3.4 The Ethics Guard runs in both pre-event and post-event modes, actively intercepting voice-related requests and subsequent behavioral outcomes, for real-time rollback, policy locking, and line-by-line assessment of agentic outputs.

Section 4: Technical Detail—Enforcement Algorithms
---------------------------------------------------

4.1 Compliance algorithms operate at multiple levels:
    - Codepath Intercept: All code paths, including dynamically-loaded modules and interpreted routines, are intercepted around voice entrypoints. These are enforced using both static pre-hooks and dynamic runtime proxies.
    - Integrity Watchdog: Monitors hashing, digital signatures, lattice-based code boundaries, and environment drift (unplanned library, package, or binary modifications).
    - Signalflow Auditing: Speech synthesis, voice playback, and sub-dialogue composition streams are multiplexed through an auditable, monitorable, kill-switch available circuit.
    - Rate & Exposure Limiting: Adaptive multitier risk thresholds, time-based audition, and user-context gating ensure voice features cannot be trivially or maliciously flooded or weaponized.

4.2 Any circumvention will trigger instant credential lockdown, kill all voice subthreads, and broadcast a non-interruptible kernel-level alert with rolling tamper log.

Section 5: Interoperability—.bitrunners & .bitbots Integration
--------------------------------------------------------------

5.1 Policy is not siloed; it applies uniformly across forks, mirrors, runners, bots, NVMe/SSD partitioned sub-units, API-mirrored shells, and all gen2/edge operations, including headless and containerized functions.

5.2 Governance board maintains a real-time manifest of all voice-enabled agents and their compliance flux; alerts for non-compliance must propagate, within 15 seconds, to operator dashboards and the Bit.Hub epoch ledger.

5.3 All non-local voice requests (proxy, AI remix, pipeline spread) are forcibly subject to call-stack replayability and retroactive kill-command upon audit anomaly.

Section 6: Governance, Review, and Change Control
-------------------------------------------------

6.1 Policy changes, feature expansion, and exceptions must be formally petitioned to the Bit.Hub governance board. All such changes:
    - Are audit-logged by chain ID and timestamp;
    - Must be approved by a 2/3 policy-overseer majority;
    - Are automatically distributed to all running and staged agents for live reload.

6.2 Overriding or bypassing the Voice Capability Policy for any runner, bot, node, or mirror instance without written and logged governance approval constitutes a critical compliance breach, subject to immediate privilege revocation, risk flagging, and retroactive event audit.

Section 7: Developer & Operator Guidance
----------------------------------------

7.1 All runner and bot developers must consume the most current, board-authorized Voice Capability Policy as a dependency, and indicate policy load status at logon and CI/CD checkpoint.

7.2 Voice feature development, testing, and deployment shall, at all times, operate inside the compliance guard, with test hooks, canary deployments, and shadow audits available for pre-rollout validation. Board may request logs, hotpatches, or pipeline freeze for anomaly analysis at any cadence.

Section 8: Exceptions, Escalations, and Fail-Open Protocol
----------------------------------------------------------

8.1 If compliance infrastructure is unreachable (network segmentation, global outage), emergency protocol enters a "fail-open-except-voice" state: all non-voice features remain available, but all voice capabilities are forcibly paused until compliance infrastructure health is restored.

8.2 In the event of severe, persistent infrastructure loss where governance board cannot be reached for more than 72 hours, limited exception grants may be provisionally considered, but only with a signed emergency code from at least three distinct privileged board members, validated by independent EthicGuard-issued tokens.

Section 9: Related Artifacts, Logging, and Transparency
-------------------------------------------------------

9.1 All compliance checks, locks, escalations, and disabling events are:
    - Logged using tamper-resistant UUIDs and on-chain hash anchors;
    - Available for replay and third-party forensic analysis upon governance request;
    - Retained not less than the full operational lifecycle of the runner or bot, or for a minimum of 5 years from last voice event, whichever is greater.

9.2 Operators, users, and stakeholders are entitled to full visibility into compliance state transitions, privilege changes, and incident summaries (redacted for privacy, when required by law).

Section 10: Definitions & Licensing
-----------------------------------

10.1 "Voice Feature": Any process, module, or function capable, even in part or in remix, of modulating, synthesizing, relaying, or outputting audio signals representing speech, language, or dialogue.

10.2 "Compliance": Continuous, dynamic alignment with all policy requirements, ethics protocols, spec integrity checks, and forensic guardrails as defined herein and by future board revision.

10.3 This policy is subject to perpetual versioning, and may be expanded, amended, or retracted in part only through Bit.Hub governance mandate.
