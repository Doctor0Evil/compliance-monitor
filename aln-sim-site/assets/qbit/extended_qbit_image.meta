# Scope: Simulation-only, CSP-clean definition of an "extended" quantum.bitmap.image (qbit)
# Purpose: Provide a richly described, non-actuating visual asset for conceptual/narrative use.
# Safety: No physical actuation, no hardware control, no quantum operations.

  title: "Extended QBIT Bitmap Image"
  description: >
    A narrative-only, extended-format bitmap representing a conceptual 'quantum-dot metaphysical-object'
    in the nanoswarm simulation. This is a visual metaphor, not a physical or quantum artifact.

    This qbit image is referenced in visual trace frames to illustrate conceptual expansion.
    It should be updated in sync with narrative changes, not physical parameters.
