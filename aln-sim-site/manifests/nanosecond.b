  description: >
    A nanosecond is one billionth of a second. In physical terms, light travels
    about 30 centimeters (roughly one foot) in this time. In our metaphysical
    environment, it represents the smallest meaningful unit of conceptual change
    ‚Äî the instant between an idea‚Äôs spark and its first ripple.
