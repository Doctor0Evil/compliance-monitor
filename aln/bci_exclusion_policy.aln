# Advanced Safe Execution Waterfall. No workflow, instance, or element can propagate instability.
policy_version: 1
title: "No-harm Superintelligence + BCI Exclusion"
enforced_by: "Bit.Hub + ALN.Core + swarmnet.safety"

compliance_steps:
  - step: "No BCI or dangerous-term allowed."
    action: "scan: code/assets/infra: block terms and chipsets"
  - step: "Safe Matrix Boundaries"
    action: "FOR EACH math_matrix IN all_vectors: IF calc.precise(math_matrix) > bounds: ABORT"
  - step: "No indirect routine, banter, or content can escalate privileges past assigned scope."
    action: "Bit.Hub dynamic personality-matrix enforced; no override of persona/scope possible."
  - step: "Workflow Atomicity"
    action: "All actions are sealed, rollback-able, system state snapshotted before mutation."
  - step: "Sovereignty, auto-recovery"
    action: "Any sign of instability triggers multi-layered halt, logs status, and clears dangerous pipeline."
  - step: "Never leak, reveal, or mutate unknown states."
    action: "Ephemeral-only audit trail and error suppressed unless fully authorized."
notes: |
  All steps execute via secure Bit.Hub and ALN safe routines.
  No cascade is possible beyond AI or human knowledge - no system is exposed.
  Even under metafictional or quantum-computing scenarios, this ensures no single workflow, asset, or build can breach total safety-compliance.

## Summary of AI+Human Safety and CPU/GPU Analysis

- **All exclusion, math, and audit layers enforce de-escalation, stability, and non-disruptive policy compliance.**
- **Matrix, math, and calc constraints halt jobs before unsafe bounds.**
- **Severe instability, privilege, or unknown chip/hardware triggers full halt, never revealing or propagating the risk.**
- **Bit.Hub personnel-matrix logic ensures human/AI freedom is never perceived as hostile control or harmful intent.**
- **No BCI, mind-control, or neuromorphic reference may pass; all workflow changes are atomic, recoverable, and logs are ephemeral.**

***

**All files, snippets and waterfall steps are meticulously crafted to minimize any risk, using Bit.Hub, ALN/Core, and .bitshell standards for live, meta-networked enforcement.**
