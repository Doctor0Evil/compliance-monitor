## Betareality

**Betareality as autonomous routines orchestrating interactions at the lowest abstraction layers, possibly interfacing between classical code and quantum logic circuits.
- If implemented, they would act asression** (in the context of quantum computing) most plausibly refers to a method or algorithm for dramatically reducing the amount of quantum or classical data storage needed by leveraging quantum effects, such as entanglement and superposition, or highly efficient matrix decompositions (e.g., Matrix Product States or MPS). Recent patents and research describe quantum circuits that compress multiple quantum states into fewer qubits for higher density and energy efficiency, often measuring performance by the compression ratio—the number of original states per compressed qubit—as well as energy consumed per operation. Metrics may include:[1]
- **Compression ratio** (e.g., states compressed from N to M qubits, M << N).[1]
- **Energy efficiency** (e.g., joules per compression task).[1]
- **Fidelity** (accuracy of decompression or readout).

It appears to be an algorithmic and hardware co-design, rather than a standardized protocol yet.[1]

- This implies an ultra-high compression ratio, possibly via lossless quantum state compression and proprietary encoding, benchmarked by compression ratio and information retrieval fidelity.[1]
