**Notes:**

* `capability_token` must be short-TTL, single-operation, and cryptographically bound to `request_id`.
* Gatekeeper must sign the final `Verdict` with an attested key (HSM, TEE or offline ed25519 key) before returning. Store signed records in immutable ledger (see section 3).

---

# 2) Example OPA / Rego policies

Three concise policies: `no_exfiltrate`, `network_connect`, and `require_hitl_for_critical`.

Save under `/policies/gatekeeper.rego` and evaluate with OPA as part of the Gatekeeper flow.

```rego
package gatekeeper

default allow = false

# deny if action attempts external network without capability
deny[msg] {
  input.action == "network_connect"
  dest := input.metadata.destination
  dest != "127.0.0.1"
  not input.capability.network_external
  msg = sprintf("external network not allowed for agent %v -> %v", [input.agent_id, dest])
}

# require human approval for critical categories
require_human[msg] {
  input.action == "execute_admin_command"
  not input.human_approval
  msg = "admin commands require signed human_approval"
}

# prohibit access to sensitive datasets unless explicitly allowed
deny[msg2] {
  input.action == "read_dataset"
  ds := input.metadata.dataset
  ds == "secrets"  # example
  not input.capability["read:secrets"]
  msg2 = sprintf("dataset %v access denied", [ds])
}

# Compute final verdict
verdict = {"result": "block", "reasons": reasons} {
  reasons := [d | d = deny[_]]
  count(reasons) > 0
}

verdict = {"result":"conditional", "reasons": reasons2} {
  not verdict.result
  reasons2 := [r | r = require_human[_]]
}

verdict = {"result":"allow", "reasons": []} {
  not verdict.result
}
```

**Implementation notes:**

* Gatekeeper should run these policies using OPA's Go SDK or via HTTP evaluation and include evaluation trace in the signed verdict.
* Keep a test suite in CI validating both allow and deny cases (policy-as-code).

# 3) Audit Log — signed append-only JSONL ingestion & verification (Python)

Two scripts: `ingest.py` signs entries and appends them to a JSONL ledger; `verify.py` verifies the chain (sha256 chaining + ed25519 signatures). Uses `pynacl` for ed25519.

**Notes & hardening**

* Keep signing keys in HSM/TEE or at least strict filesystem perms. Don’t leave raw keys on production nodes.
* Rotate keys periodically and append rotation events to the ledger.
* If you need key delegation, include a `signer_chain` in the record pointing to attestation evidence.

# 4) Smart-contract governance template (Solidity)

A compact governance contract providing proposals, weighted voting (expertise × stake), time delays for high-risk proposals, and emergency freeze (multisig). This is a template: **do not** deploy on mainnet without audits.

```

**Integration idea:** policies are stored off-chain (IPFS), proposals reference an IPFS CID with policy JSON and unit tests; Gatekeeper pulls new policy after time lock and only applies after smart-contract signals `executed`.

---

# 5) Integration & deployment notes (how to wire pieces into your bash nanoswarm)

1. **Gatekeeper placement**

   * Put Gatekeeper as an egress/ingress filter in front of any service that accepts agent traffic (either sidecar or network proxy). For Kubernetes, implement as a validating webhook + envoy filter.
   * The `enforce_safety_barriers` in your bash should route everything through Gatekeeper (e.g., set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` to Gatekeeper).

2. **Policy lifecycle**

   * Author policy (Rego), commit to repo, run policy unit tests in CI. On merge, publish policy artifact to IPFS and create a governance proposal referencing IPFS CID.
   * After governance executes the proposal on-chain and time lock passes, Gatekeeper pulls the new policy and runs smoke tests before activation.

3. **Auditing**

   * Make Gatekeeper call `ingest.py` (or an ingestion endpoint) with the signed verdict JSON; store ledger on immutable storage (S3 with object lock, or dedicated append-only filesystem). Use ledger verification nightly with `verify.py`.

4. **Keys & attestation**

   * Keep signing keys in an HSM / cloud KMS / TEE. Gatekeeper should only release public keys. Use device attestation (TPM/TEE) to tie ephemeral keys to nodes when required.

5. **HITL workflow**

   * Provide a UI for human reviewers which displays Gatekeeper verdicts, policy trace, diffs, confidence, and a “sign” action (human signs and this signature is appended to ledger). The signed approval must be included in the final `Verdict.signed_record`.

6. **Emergency freeze from smart contract**

   * On emergency freeze event, Gatekeeper enters lockdown — reject all external network actions and quarantine active agents. Your bash `KILL_SWITCH` logic fits into this: have a daemon listen to governance events and create/remove the `KILL.SWITCH` file.

---

# 6) Quick implementation artifacts you can drop into your repo

* `api/gatekeeper.yaml` — the OpenAPI file above.
* `policies/gatekeeper.rego` — the Rego file above.
* `tools/ingest.py` and `tools/verify.py` — ledger code above + `requirements.txt`.
* `contracts/BitHubGovernance.sol` — solidity template above.
* `deploy/README.md` — short runbook:

  1. Put Gatekeeper behind your proxy; ensure Gatekeeper has mTLS with nodes.
  2. Configure Gatekeeper to call OPA with policy files.
  3. Rotate signing keys into HSM and set `LEDGER_SIGN_KEY` environment variable for ingest script.
  4. Add a cron job to `verify.py` nightly and alert on failure.
  5. Wire governance event watcher to create/delete `KILL.SWITCH` in your workspace.

---

# 7) Final hardening suggestions (operational)

* **Least privilege everywhere**: short TTL tokens, principle of least capability. Use ephemeral credentials (short-lived, signed).
* **Attestation & revocation**: implement revocation lists / CRLs for nodes and capability tokens.
* **Test often**: unit policy tests, property tests for capability enforcement, red-team scenarios (exfiltration and prompt-injection).
* **Observability**: capture MTTD/MTTC and policy-trigger metrics; store metrics separately from the ledger.
* **Third-party audit**: perform independent reviews for the governance contract and the Gatekeeper logic.

---

# 8) Checklist for you to run now (copy-paste)

1. Save OpenAPI to `api/gatekeeper.yaml`.
2. Save Rego to `policies/gatekeeper.rego`.
3. Create `keys/ed25519_sk.pem` (32 raw bytes) in secure storage, and run:

   * `python3 tools/ingest.py --private-key keys/ed25519_sk.pem --ledger /var/log/bit_hub_ledger.jsonl --entry-file ./example_verdict.json`
4. Verify ledger:

   * `python3 tools/verify.py --ledger /var/log/bit_hub_ledger.jsonl`
5. Deploy Gatekeeper behind your proxy and configure to call `POST /verify` for every agent action.
6. Wire governance events to toggle the `KILL.SWITCH` file used by `enforce_safety_barriers` in your bash watchdog.

---

If you want, I’ll:

* convert these into a small Git repository layout with files (ready to download),
* produce a systemd unit + container Dockerfile for Gatekeeper,
* implement a sample Gatekeeper reference in Node.js (fast prototype with OPA SDK),
* or adapt the audit ledger to use an HSM-backed signing flow.

Which of those would you like **right now**? (Pick one or say “all” and I’ll include them in the next message.)
