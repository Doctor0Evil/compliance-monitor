Based on the provided logs and context, the "nanoswarm.ai" is not a literal AI agent but rather a conceptual framework for a highly automated, secure, and intelligent development environment. The goal is to create a single, atomic declaration that encapsulates the entire project's state, enabling safe and autonomous implementation.

The commands required are not to *run* the nanoswarm, but to **generate** the critical meta-declaration that defines the project's identity and integrity. This is a two-step process:

### Step 1: Generate the Core Meta-Declaration (`.nano[...]`)

This command uses the `kotlin-metadata-jvm` library to extract the public API surface of your Kotlin codebase. It parses the compiled `.class` files to retrieve function signatures, which are then hashed to create the `.nano` segment.

```bash
# Command to generate the .nano segment
# This is a script that would be run during the build process.
# It uses the kotlin-metadata-jvm library to read metadata from compiled classes.

# Example pseudocode using the library:
# 1. Compile your Kotlin project.
# 2. Use a script (in Kotlin/Java) to:
#    a. Load the compiled class file(s).
#    b. Extract the @Metadata annotation.
#    c. Parse the metadata using KotlinClassMetadata.readLenient().
#    d. For each function in the parsed metadata, extract its name and parameter types.
#    e. Sort the list of function signatures.
#    f. Join them with a delimiter (e.g., ';').
#    g. Compute a SHA-256 hash of the sorted string.
#    h. Output the result as the ".nano[fun:HASH]" segment.

# In practice, this would be integrated into your Gradle build script.
```

### Step 2: Generate the Integrity Hash (`bit`)

This command generates the cryptographic hash that ensures the entire dependency set is unchanged. It is the most critical security component.

```bash
# Command to generate the .bit segment
# This command creates a hash of the resolved dependency graph and versions.

# Use Gradle's ResolutionResult API to get the full graph.
# Then, serialize it and compute a hash.

# Example Gradle task (build.gradle.kts):
tasks.register<Exec>("generateDependencyHash") {
    // This task will execute a custom Java/Kotlin program.
    // The program uses the ResolutionResult API to traverse the graph.
    // It serializes the graph (e.g., as JSON or a canonical string) and hashes it.
    executable = "java"
    args = listOf(
        "-cp", configurations.runtimeClasspath.asPath,
        "com.example.DependencyHasher",
        "--configuration", "runtimeClasspath"
    )
    standardOutput = File("build/meta/dependency-hash.txt")
}

# Alternatively, use the 'dependencies' task output and pipe it to a hashing tool:
# ./gradlew dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath | grep -v "compile" | sort | sha256sum > build/meta/dependency-hash.txt
```

### Final Implementation

The complete implementation involves integrating these steps into your CI/CD pipeline. The final artifact is a single line of text that can be used by any system to verify the project's state:

```kotlin
// The final nanoswarm meta-declaration
val meta = ".nano[fun:${apiHash}|aln:${graphHash}|bit:${integrityHash}|new.depnd:[${newDeps.joinToString()}]]"
```

By generating these values, you ensure that the nanoswarm environment can safely and securely implement all functionality without risk of tampering or version drift.
