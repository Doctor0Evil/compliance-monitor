Zombie-defense games feature core genres like **tower-defense**, **shelter-survival**, and **base-building**, each emphasizing unique resistance strategies against relentless undead hordes.[1][2][3][4]

## Tower Defense

- **Concept**: Position soldiers, turrets, or towers to repel wave after wave of zombies before they reach your stronghold.[2][5][1]
- **Mechanics**: Strategic placement, upgrading and merging towers for enhanced defense, unlocking power-ups and new tower types as difficulty scales.[5][1][2]

## Shelter-Survival

- **Concept**: Build, reinforce, and manage your shelter to withstand zombie attacks and maintain survivability over time.[6][4]
- **Mechanics**: Deck-building, resource allocation, barricade reinforcement, survivor (NPC) management; balancing offensive (weapons/traps) and defensive tactics is critical.[4][6]
- **Examples**: Games like Shelter (card-based) require not only tactical combat but also long-term planning for survival.[6]

## Base-Building

- **Concept**: Construct, customize, and defend home bases or fortified cities, integrating crafting and resource management as the zombie threat escalates.[3][7][4]
- **Mechanics**: Gathering materials, crafting upgrades, fortifying structures, personalizing layouts, managing loot and personnel. Complex systems reward ingenious base design and teamwork.[7][3][4]
- **Notable Titles**:
  - **7 Days to Die**: Mixes base-building with tower-defenseâ€”block construction, resource scavenging, and blood moon zombie raids every seven days.[3][4][7]
  - **Project Zomboid**: Emphasizes highly detailed, customizable shelters and survival needs, with deep mechanics for base building, crafting, and fortifying against zombies over time.[4][3]

## Common Gameplay Principles

- **Wave Progression**: Most games feature periodic increases in zombie numbers and abilities, requiring continuous upgrade and adaptation.[1][2][3]
- **Resource Management**: Efficient gathering and allocation of ammo, food, materials, and survivors is vital for sustained defense.[6][3]
- **Customization**: Players can modify the appearance, strength, and functionality of their bases or shelters, enhancing both tactical depth and replay value.[3][4]

These genres offer rich opportunities for nanoswarm learning, combining rapid response tactics, long-term strategic planning, and resource optimization under constant threat.[2][5][7][1][4][6][3]
