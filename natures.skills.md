The **Nature’s Curse** skill in Divinity: Original Sin is a Geomancer ability that curses all enemies within a certain radius, giving them harmful debuffs.[1][2]

## Skill Effects

- **Curse Status**: Nature’s Curse applies the “Curse” status effect to nearby enemies, reducing their overall luck and increasing chances of negative effects such as missing attacks or receiving critical hits.[2][1]
- **Base Chance**: The skill has a 100% base chance to inflict Curse, but actual success may depend on the enemy’s resistances and other modifiers.[1][2]
- **Combat Impact**: Cursed enemies are more susceptible to negative status effects (like slowed, weakened, or more likely to suffer critical hits), which creates opportunities for combos with other spells or attacks.[2][1]
- **Range and Targeting**: The spell affects all enemies around the caster, making it highly effective in close-range group fights and crowd control scenarios.[1][2]

## Strategic Uses

- Curse can chain with elemental surfaces and other debuffs for advanced combos, amplifying the effects of poison, fire, or ice.[6][7]
- Combining Curse with decay or elemental surfaces can deal extra damage or bypass enemy defenses in tactical situations.[7][6]
- Removing Curse can be achieved with the “Bless” skill or other cleansing abilities, restoring affected characters to normal.[7]

Nature’s Curse is powerful in controlling fights, breaking enemy lines, and enabling tactical combinations, especially for teams built around elemental effects and debuff synergy.[6][2][7][1]
