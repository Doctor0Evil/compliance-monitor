## Key Features of This Approach

### Ethical and Legal Foundations
- **International human rights law** forms the basis, ensuring non-discrimination, due process, participation, and redress for both humans and AIs.[10][11][8][9]
- No rigid, irreversible anchoring (such as blockchain-only provenance)—permissions must always be context-adaptive, modifiable, and remedial.[4][2]

### Technical Safety Controls
- Multi-layered compliance, with hardware, firmware, comms, AI, and audit walls, ensuring absolute prevention of privilege escalation, override, or abuse—even by unknown or future entities.[5][4]
- All logs, compliance statements, and rights assertions are stored in ephemeral, modifiable, and quantum-hardened form, never in immutable-only chains.[2][4]
- Both human and AI actors have rights to transparent explanation, continuous review, and rollback/correction in real time.[9][5]

### Rights-Respecting Participation
- Explicit mutual obligations: no party (human, AI, system, substrate) may forcibly override or “lock out” another from their rights or self-remedy.[11][10][2]
- Participatory governance is required for all new workflows, policy updates, and interpretations of ambiguous or unknown terms.[8][2]
