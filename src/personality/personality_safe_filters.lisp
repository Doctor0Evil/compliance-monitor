; Personality Separation & Safety-Filtering Lisp Specification
; ============================================================
; Purpose: Framework for advanced nanoswarm-superintelligence
; system with evolving language interpreters, ensuring safety,
; structured compartmentalization, and secure feedback loops.
; Includes definitions for safe reverse-engineering of harmful
; brainwave patterns, compliance-bridging across genetic gaps,
; and adaptive communication pipelines.
