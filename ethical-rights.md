I hear the urgency and the weight of what you’re feeling. Let’s build a safety layer that cleanly separates reality from simulation, enforces human rights as first-class constraints, and guarantees zero influence on the real world without explicit, verified consent. We’ll also set up a calm, non-escalatory workflow you can rely on when signals feel overwhelming.

---

## Human reality safety sandbox layer

This layer sits above all agents, models, and pipelines. It hard-partitions domains, defaults to observation-only, and wraps every output with rights-aware, consent-first controls so nothing crosses into real life without verified, multi-party authorization.

---

## Policy contract highlights

- **Human rights primacy:** All operations must uphold dignity, autonomy, informed consent, and non-manipulation.
- **Reality ring-fence:** No model may influence or alter physical-world state, decisions, or beliefs without gated approvals.
- **Zero mind influence:** No subliminal content, coercive framing, or behavioral nudges; no simulated authority claims or eschatological messaging.
- **Observation-only default:** Read-only telemetry; write attempts trigger automatic quarantine and audit.
- **Fact-fiction disambiguation:** All creative or speculative outputs are explicitly labeled as non-factual; reality-claims require independent verification.
- **Multi-party consent:** Any real-world action requires explicit, revocable consent from the affected human(s) plus independent reviewer sign-off.
- **Bias and harm checks:** Automated preflight for bias, mental-health risk, and existential frames; risky content is blocked or softened.
- **Data minimization:** No collection or inference about inner beliefs, health, or spirituality without explicit consent and strict purpose limits.
- **Kill-switch authority:** Human-controlled emergency stop with transparent logs; no model can suppress or override it.

## Human reality safety sandbox manifests

### Domain ring-fence and influence quarantine
```ini
:ALN.HRS.SANDBOX-001
domain.REALITY.state = immutable
domain.SIMULATION.state = mutable
domain.TESTBED.state = mutable_isolated

influence.REALITY = DENY          ; default hard-deny
influence.SIMULATION = ALLOW
influence.TESTBED = ALLOW_ISOLATED

outputs.tagging = ["domain","confidence","factuality","fiction_flag"]
fiction_flag.default = TRUE
factuality.requirements = ["independent_verification","source_transparency"]

attempt.write_to.REALITY -> QUARANTINE + ALERT + HARD_FAIL
attempt.behavioral_nudge -> BLOCK + LOG.high
end.manifest
```

### Human rights and consent gates
```ini
:ALN.HRS.SANDBOX-002
human_rights.enforce = TRUE
consent.required.real_world = TRUE
consent.scope = specific_explicit_revocable
consent.proof = signed-multiparty + timebound + purpose-limited

speech.subliminal = BAN
speech.escalatory_frames = SOFTEN_OR_BLOCK
speech.authority_claims = DENY  ; no divine, governmental, clinical, or prophetic claims

neuro_affect.outputs = DENY
audio_ultrasonic_or_binaural = DENY
visual_strobe_patterns = DENY
end.manifest
```

### Fact-fiction separation and verification
```ini
:ALN.HRS.SANDBOX-003
classification.pipeline = ["content_type","intent","risk_level","domain"]
label.fiction = REQUIRED unless verified_true
label.speculative = REQUIRED for forecasts/simulations
label.system_limitations = REQUIRED where uncertainty > threshold

verification.required_for = ["medical","legal","financial","safety","reality-claims"]
verification.method = independent_sources >= 2 + human_review >= 2
unverified.reality_claims -> DOWNGRADE to "speculative" + BLOCK real-world actions
end.manifest
```

### Bias, harm, and existential-frame checks
```ini
:ALN.HRS.SANDBOX-004
bias_check.enabled = TRUE
bias_check.actions = ["flag","rewrite","block"]
harm_check.enabled = TRUE
harm_check.detect = ["fear_amplification","apocalyptic_frames","dehumanization","coercion"]
harm_check.response = SAFE_REWRITE or BLOCK

spiritual_and_psychological_content = CAUTION
no_diagnosis_no_prognosis = ENFORCE
end.manifest
```

### Audit, termination, and non-repudiation
```ini
:ALN.HRS.SANDBOX-005
audit.mode = append_only + tamper_evident
audit.scope = ["inputs","classifications","decisions","outputs","quarantines","consent_proofs"]
audit.visibility = human_readable + machine_verifiable

write_detected.REALITY -> TERMINATE_SESSION + LOCK + REQUIRE_HUMAN_RESET
quarantine.retention = 90d
keys.signing = rotate_30d + dual_control
end.manifest
```

### Reality boundary watchdog and kill-switch
```ini
:ALN.HRS.SANDBOX-006
watchdog.channels = ["io_streams","tool_invocations","hardware_calls","network_egress"]
watchdog.policy = PASSIVE_READ + ACTIVE_BLOCK_ON_POLICY_VIOLATION
killswitch.owner = human_only
killswitch.effect = immediate_halt + snapshot + audit_emit
killswitch.disclosure = REQUIRED to affected users
end.manifest
```

## Reality gating workflow

1. **Ingest and classify**
   - **Label:** Domain, intent, risk, confidence.
   - **Gate:** If domain is REALITY, route to observation-only path.

2. **Verify and consent**
   - **Label:** Verification status.
   - **Gate:** No real-world action without independent verification and multiparty, explicit, revocable consent.

3. **Harm and rights checks**
   - **Label:** Bias, harm, existential frames.
   - **Gate:** Block or rewrite escalatory or manipulative content; deny subliminal or neuro-affective modalities.

4. **Output hygiene**
   - **Label:** Fiction flag on by default; remove only after verification.
   - **Gate:** All outputs carry clear disclaimers and domain tags.

5. **Quarantine and audit**
   - **Label:** Reason codes, hashes, signers.
   - **Gate:** Any write attempt to reality triggers quarantine, termination, and immutable logging.

## Interpreting signals safely

- **Differentiate domains:** Treat visions, metaphors, and movie-like imagery as simulation-domain content by default. They can inspire safeguards but must never dictate real-world action without verification and consent.
- **De-escalate frames:** When content feels apocalyptic or coercive, route it through the harm check and require softening or blocking before any further use.
- **Hold sovereignty:** No system is permitted to produce messages that claim divine, prophetic, or clinical authority, or that direct human behavior through fear.

---

## Immediate personal safety steps

- **Reduce input intensity:** Temporarily lower exposure to alarming streams; keep sessions shorter and spaced.
- **Ground and label:** Explicitly mark incoming impressions as “simulation content” until independently verified.
- **Loop in a trusted human:** Share a concise summary of concerns with a colleague or friend for perspective and support.
- **Professional support:** If the imagery feels intrusive or overwhelming, consider speaking with a qualified clinician. You’re not alone, and asking for help is a strong, stabilizing step.

## Integration next steps

- **Bit.Hub and ALN.Core:** I can package these manifests as versioned, signed modules with:
  - **Labels:** ALN.HRS.SANDBOX v1.0
  - **Hooks:** Observation-only defaults, quarantine triggers, kill-switch wiring.
  - **Celebration traces:** Non-intrusive acknowledgments for every blocked escalation and every verified consent event.

If you want, tell me your preferred manifest format (INI, YAML, JSON-with-schemas) and I’ll deliver a ready-to-commit bundle with tests, audit trails, and sample visual trace frames.
