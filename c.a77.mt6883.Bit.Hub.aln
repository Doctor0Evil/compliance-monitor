Specifications
Delivering premium performance with best-in-class power efficiency to mobile and laptop devices in a soon to be 5G connected world. The Arm Cortex-A77 CPU is the third-generation premium core built on DynamIQ technology. It can be paired with Cortex-A55 CPUs in a scalable DynamIQ big.LITTLE configuration. Cortex-A77 delivers higher performance with greater efficiency to all mobile and laptop devices. Consumers are now demanding greater performance from their devices along with multi day battery life. Cortex-A77 enables the end user to enjoy sustained high performance across even the most complex compute tasks in a soon to be 5G connected world. Building on the best-in-class power and area efficiency originally established with previous generations of Cortex-A processors.
