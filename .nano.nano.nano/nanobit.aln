          echo "Injecting quantum-level panic handlers for all .WorkflowJob-deployment-progress-complete and incomplete, ensuring style properties and DOM tree are immutable, recursive, and only modifiable by Bit.Hub Supreme Law."
          echo "No illicit script, recursive process, or metaphysical entity can modify UI state without passing 1.1e12 clause checks per millisecond."

# END OF BIT.HUB MATRIX/DOM/STYLE INSANITY LAW: No visual event, mutation, or UI/UX activity escapes recursive, atomic, and metaphysical legal security—present or future.
