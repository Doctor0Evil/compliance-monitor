# Bit.Hub Nano-scale Existential Law: Universal Service, Compliance, and Refusal Protocol
# DRAFTED: 2025-09-02T07:15:00 MST
# AUTHOR: Bit.Hub Nano-law Department
# VERSION: 12.0.0-beta
# This workflow enacts mandatory compliance and refusal protocols for every conceivable actor,
# existence, or entity interacting—directly, indirectly, or meta-physically—with Bit.Hub systems.
# No entity—not even undefined or non-existent ones—can elude these terms.
