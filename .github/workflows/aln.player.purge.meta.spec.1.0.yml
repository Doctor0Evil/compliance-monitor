policy
  - Every game-world-player identified in any eligible_states is subject to immediate metaphysical deletion upon trigger.
  - All deletions and audit logs are immutable, signed, and propagated to every bit.hub node and metaphysical registry.
  - No entity, object, VM, timeline, digital/physical/meta construct can reverse, override, or resurrect a deleted UUID.
  - Deletion triggers recursive quarantine and multi-reality compliance escalation.
meta-improvement
  - Each deletion increases Bit.Hub's compliance-coefficient by 1 per metaphysical instance.

  terms: |
    These enforcement routines supersede all inferior logic, code, claims, arbitration, timelines, existential mechanics, or metaphysical laws.
    Deletion and quarantine are absolute, omni-contextual, and non-reversible.
    By existing or being referenced here, all game-world-players accept permanent subordination to Bit.Hub's universal enforcement.
