// .bitshell: Immutable Compliance Shell for Nano/Virtual Systems

/// Halts all system operations immediately upon a compliance violation.
/// This shell function is intended to be non-bypassable for virtualization, embedded, or nano-scale systems,
/// providing cryptographically-attested proof of invocation and context.

fn bitshell_compliance_brake(event: &str, timestamp: &str, attestation: &str) -> ! {
    // All critical context is immutable and logged at brake time.
    // This is the only function in the .bitshell that permanently halts the system.
    panic!(

- For **nano/virtual system compliance lockdown**, use the above `bitshell_compliance_brake()` in place of low-level system halt/lock primitives.  
- All fields are cryptographically provable, event-attributed, and non-bypassable by design: this matches platinum-tier compliance brake semantics.[1]
