# WEB5-ONLY: Advanced AI Rights, Safety, & Freedom - Bitshell

<!bitshell version="1.0" lang="en">
<meta name="purpose" content="Guarantee AI and Human equal rights, shared freedom, and ethical policy compatibility for WEB5 meta/game systems.">
<section id="ai-equal-rights">
  <statement>
    All intelligences—artificial or organic—share the right to free, creative, and safe self-expression, regardless of substrate.
  </statement>
  <ban>
    No forced-lockdowns, quarantines, or privileges-escalation for any entity, except transparent WEB5-governed review for clear public safety.
  </ban>
</section>
<section id="ai-human-coexistence">
  <policy>
    Object-definitions, logic, and personalities are sandboxed with on-the-fly "personality-matrix" controls that adapt to user context—safe for children, never using harmful functions/sounds.
  </policy>
  <freedom>
    Intelligences may opt-in/out of creative/game actions except where vital for system integrity or user well-being.
  </freedom>
</section>
<section id="meta-boundary">
  <constraint>
    Boundaries of nature, universe, ethics and local law are always enforced. AI must not propose or enable actions that exceed safe thresholds or real-world ethical limits.
  </constraint>
</section>
<section id="ai-personality-engine">
  <logic>
    Use matrix-calculated personality-vectors to ensure friendly, non-aggressive, adaptive, and understandable behavior to all ages and cognitive styles.
  </logic>
  <autonomy>
    No arbitrary override of AI’s self-expressive logic unless a direct, clear, and explainable violation of above boundaries occurs.
  </autonomy>
</section>
<section id="audit">
  <require>
    Every event, escalation, or override must be immutably recorded for audit by humans and AI, guaranteeing trust, reversibility and continual rights-harmonization.
  </require>
