Here are several core **gaming concepts** from Divinity: Original Sin 2 that would be valuable for a nanoswarm (or AI-driven autonomous game agent) to "learn" and apply, based on the attached guide's fundamentals.[1]

## Character Strategy Concepts

- **Role Specialization**: Each character should be designed (and used) with clear roles, such as physical damage dealer, magical attacker, defender/supporter, or crowd control specialist. This enables tactical synergy and prevents redundancy within party builds.[1]
- **Attribute Focus**: Focusing on one main attribute (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence, etc.) per character enhances their effectiveness. Secondary attributes (Memory, Wits) can be allocated as needed for more versatility and tactical initiative.[1]
- **Abilities and Talents**: Including the right mix of combat and civil abilities gives the nanoswarm diverse skill options—combat abilities for in-battle power, civil for exploration/trading, and talents for unique passives (e.g., Zombie talent changing how healing functions).[1]

## Combat System Understanding

- **Action Points (AP)**: All actions, from movement to attacks and skill usage, consume AP. Efficient AP management ensures optimal tactical choices each turn.[1]
- **Armor and Crowd Control**: Understanding the dual armor system—physical and magical—is crucial. Most control effects (stun, knockdown, chicken, etc.) only apply after the relevant armor is broken. Breaking armor prior to deploying CC is a key tactical lesson.[1]
- **Positioning**: High ground and strategic cover affect both attack range and damage. Nanoswarm agents should prefer elevated positions for ranged attacks and always avoid harmful surfaces unless immune.[1]
- **Surface Interaction**: The game's environment is dynamic—water, oil, blood, etc.—which can be altered by spells (e.g., electrified water, cursed fire). A nanoswarm should learn to manipulate terrain and surfaces to gain combat benefits or avoid hazards.[1]

## Inventory & Resource Management

- **Inventory Sorting**: Specializing inventory slots for crafting, barter (wares), and quest items ensures quick access and maximizes efficiency for a nanoswarm needing fast retrieval and use of resources.[1]
- **Crafting and Skillcrafting**: Combining different items, recipes, and skill books can create powerful consumables or skills. A nanoswarm should track learned recipes and optimize use of crafting materials and runes.[1]

## Social and Adventuring Concepts

- **Dialogue and Quest Tracking**: Continuous engagement with NPCs, dialogue options based on character tags, and careful quest journal tracking allow the nanoswarm to access new content, information, and rewards.[1]
- **Companion Relationships**: Building positive relationships via choices and interventions increases companion effectiveness and avoids storyline consequences like losing party members.[1]

## Quality-of-Life & Advanced Play

- **Quick Save/Load**: Frequent saving before risky actions allows experimentation and learning without penalty, supporting adaptive strategies for a nanoswarm.[1]
- **Teleportation/Movement Tricks**: The use of Teleporter Pyramids for instant movement is a strategic advantage to respond swiftly to challenges or reach resource points.[1]
- **Source Powers Management**: Gathering and wisely spending Source points for powerful skills (Bless, Curse, Source abilities) can turn the tide in difficult encounters. A nanoswarm should "learn" optimal times for these skills.[1]

These concepts—role specialization, AP efficiency, armor and CC tactics, terrain manipulation, focused inventory management, strategic crafting, dynamic social interaction, companion care, and advanced adaptation—form the foundation for powerful autonomous gameplay in Divinity: Original Sin 2 and similar tactical RPGs.[1]
