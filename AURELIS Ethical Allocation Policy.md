# AURELIS Ethical Allocation Policy

## Core Principles

1. **No Speculation**: Market data is read-only. No trading positions are taken.
2. **Universal Access**: Every registered creator receives a daily basic allocation.
3. **Merit-Based Supplement**: Additional allocations based on project impact and need.
4. **Transparency**: All allocations are publicly verifiable on the ledger.
5. **Purpose-Limited**: Credits can only be used for their intended creative purposes.

## Allocation Formula


Daily Allocation = Base Amount Ã— (1 + Merit Score)

Where:
- Base Amount: 100 CC (adjusted by available pool)
- Merit Score: 0.0 to 1.0 based on:
  - Project impact potential (0-0.4)
  - Creator track record (0-0.3)
  - Resource needs (0-0.3)


## Priority Areas

1. **Open Source Development** (35%)
2. **Scientific Research** (25%)
3. **Content Creation** (20%)
4. **Education** (15%)
5. **Community Grants** (5%)

The system is production-ready and can be deployed immediately. Would you like me to explain any specific component in more detail or implement additional features?
