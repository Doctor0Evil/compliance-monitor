see you're interested in advanced blockchain-federated learning integration. Let me break down what's currently achievable with today's technology:
 blockchain verification of critical model updates

### Technical Limitations

Important constraints to consider:

1. **Blockchain Scalability**: Transaction throughput limits model update frequency
2. **Computational Overhead**: Consensus mechanisms add significant processing time
3. **Integration Complexity**: Requires expertise in both domains

### Getting Started

If you want to implement a blockchain-federated learning system:

1. Define clear privacy and security requirements
